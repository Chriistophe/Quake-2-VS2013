Quake-2-VS2013
==============

Building Quake 2 using Visual Studio 2013

The goal of this project is to build the Quake 2 source code available on id Software's GitHub account in a modern
Visual Studio environment.

The Visual Studio files that come with the source code are hopelessly out of date, and nearly impossible to work with,
even on a Windows XP machine running Visual C++ 6.0. Believe me, I've tried. So rather than continue to wrestle with that,
I have recreated the project instead.

Please go to my website and comment if you would like to watch the videos, or if you have any questions.
