Quake-2-VS2013
==============

Building Quake 2 using Visual Studio 2013

The goal of this project is to build the Quake 2 source code available on id Software's GitHub account in a modern
Visual Studio environment.

The Visual Studio files that come with the source code are hopelessly out of date, and nearly impossible to work with,
even on a Windows XP machine running Visual C++ 6.0. Believe me, I've tried. So rather than continue to wrestle with that,
I have recreated the project instead.

Please go to my website if you would like to watch the videos, or if you have any questions.

This project is the exact same project created in the videos, except there were some extra unnecessary files left in that I have deleted. They are:

/quake2.vcxproj.user<br />
/win32/q2.aps<br />
/win32/winquake.aps<br />
/win32/qe3.ico<br />
/win32/winquake.rc<br />

All the best,<br />
Philip
